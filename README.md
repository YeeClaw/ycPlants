# Hello! #

*Celestial Crops* is a terraria mod that aims to add more useful plants that provide resources other than potion ingredients. Keep in mind that the current build is in early alpha

## Current additions ##

* Stardust seeds
	* Lets you plant a fallen star crop

## How to harvest the crops ##

All crops have their own unique blocks and conditions that they need in order to grow. However, it is universal that all crops *must* be harvested at full growth with a sickle
in order to get maximum drops. Below are crop specific conditions for growth.
* Star Crop
	* Must grow on clouds (normal, rain and snow!)


## Where can I get it? ##

YCPlants can be added to your Terraria game through the modbrowser on TmodLoader
